    "text": "QUESTION|TASK 2\nIf you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?\nThe name Brittney peaked in the year 1990, and the average birth year for all people named Brittany is 1991. This means that there is a high probability that the person on the phone is around the age 33. To be safe, you could assume that the person is between the ages 30-37. It would much less likely for the person to be around my age, 19, because the graph looks like the year 2005 is about 3 standard deviations away from the mean. As well as for over the age 44, because that seems to be close to the 3rd standard deviation as well. \n\n\nShow the code\n#Making the bar plot\nfig2 = px.bar(\n    df.query('name == \"Brittany\"'),\n    x = 'year',\n    y = 'Total',\n    title = 'The Name Brittany Over Time'\n)\n#Renaming the x axis so there is not a lower case, and changing title size\nfig2.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Year\",\n    title_font = dict(size = 24),\n)\n#Updating the range of y axis to make more room for the arrows\nfig2.update_yaxes(\n    range = [0, 40000]\n)\n#Vertical line at average year\nfig2.add_vline(\n    x = 1991,\n    line_dash = 'dot',\n    line_color = 'black'\n)\n#Arrow pointing to peak\nfig2.add_annotation(\n    x=1990, \n    y=max(df.query('name == \"Brittany\"')['Total']), \n    text=\"Peak\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1,\n    ax=-40,  \n    ay=-30,\n    arrowcolor=\"red\",\n    font= dict(color=\"red\")\n)\n#Arrow pointing to average year vertical line\nfig2.add_annotation(\n    x=1991, \n    y=35000, \n    text=\"Average Year\",\n    showarrow=True,\n    arrowhead=1,\n    ax=40,  \n    ay=-20,\n    arrowcolor=\"black\",\n    font= dict(color=\"black\")\n)\n#Computing the average year that the name Brittany was used\ntotal_occurrences = df.query(\"name == 'Brittany'\")['Total'].sum()\naverage_year = (df.query(\"name == 'Brittany'\")['Total'] * df.query(\"name == 'Brittany'\")['year']).sum() / total_occurrences\nage = 2024 - average_year\nprint(f\"Average Age of All People Named Brittney: {age:.0f}\")\n\nfig2\n\n\nAverage Age of All People Named Brittney: 33\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe graph provides a label for the peak year, and the average year. You can see that the graph follows a normal distribution, so it is more likely for the person named Brittany to be around 33 years old considering that is the average.",
